# Tic-Tac-Toe

Build an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with React

## Development

**Done:**
- functional version to play
- indicate when a player has won the game
- store the move history as the game progresses
- allow players to review the game history by displaying the board for each move

**Some ideas for improvements:**
- For the current move only, show "You are at move #..." instead of a button
- Rewrite `Board` to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw)
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list
